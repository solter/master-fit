#Master Fit
A modern (3.4) python class to perform polynomial interpolations.

##User friendly functionality beyond numpy
This project aims to provide a simple interface,
yet allows for high levels of options for those that
desire it.

##Local **and** global interpolations available
A major feature of this class is the ability to create interpolating polynomials
using the bare minimum of surrounding points. Thus the interpolation can be made 
accurate in a local region about a desired point. This locality aviods wasting 
degrees of freedom far from the region of interest. It can also produce global
interpolating functions if the user desires
